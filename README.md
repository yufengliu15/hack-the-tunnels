# Event Setup Instructions

To avoid many of the environment setup-related issues that occur with Windows, we will be having all [Hack The Tunnels 2024](https://ccss.carleton.ca/hackthetunnels/) participants set up [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

If you are a Windows user, you should follow the [Windows Setup](#windows-setup) and then follow the [Project Setup](#project-setup) in your new WSL environment.

If you are a Mac or Linux user, instead follow the [Mac Setup](#mac-setup) and then follow the [Project Setup](#project-setup) instructions.

Both guides will have you set up [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage dependencies. Homebrew will help you install additional software like Node.js, Git, Gh, etc.


## Windows Setup
In Powershell or Command Prompt, run the following commands

1. Install WSL

```
wsl --install
```

2. Set WSL to use version 2 as the default.

```
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

3. Install the Ubuntu distribution within WSL.

```
wsl --install -d ubuntu
```
**Note: You will need to create a Linux user**

4. Install Homebrew

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to add Homebrew to your PATH.

```
(This will be instructions displayed after the Homebrew installation)
```

6. Refresh your terminal session to apply the changes made to .bashrc

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

7. Install Node.js

```
brew install node
```

8. Install Git

```
brew install git
```

## Mac Setup
In the Terminal, run the following commands

1. Install Homebrew

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install Node.js

```
brew install node
```

3. Install Git

```
brew install git
```

## Project Setup

### Create a Github Repository for the Project 

For each team, one member should create the repository and all members of a team should clone the same repository

Click on "Use this template" > Create a new repository

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccefc342-83b2-4258-aa73-bc061358008a)

In your WSL terminal (for Windows) or the terminal (for Mac), run the following commands

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repository-name.git
```

2. Move into the project directory

```
cd your-repository-name
```

### Client Setup

1. Move into the client directory

```
cd client
```

2. Install client dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Run the client

```
npm run dev
```

### Service Setup

Follow the following instructions in a 2nd terminal while your client is running.

1. Move into the service directory

```
cd service
```

2. Install service dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Run Migrations

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

4. Run the service

```
npm run dev
```

To get the project working, you will need to have both the client and server running.

# Documentation

The project template for this year is a recreation of the **infamously hard to use Carleton Central**.

Students will be tasked with recreating and improving many of the core components of the application.


## Important Files and Folders

### Client

- `main.tsx`: Initialises app and describes routing for pages
- `client/src/pages`: Where code for individual pages in the web app live
- `client/src/components`: Where code for "components" (ui pieces reusable across pages) live
- `client/src/layouts`: Where code for "layouts", which are kind of like "page themes" live
- `client/src/infrastructure/ServiceAPI`: Where code the evokes the Service via RESTful API live

### Service

- `service/src/api/router.ts`: Where Express.js RESTful API routes are defined
- `service/src/api/routes`: Where all other routers are defined
- `service/src/services`: "Services" are code that handle "business logic" like creating a timetable, handling user login, etc.
- `service/src/db/schema.prisma`: Where our database's schema is defiend. A database schema is the "shape" our data is stored in.

## Views

### Login Page - `/`

The following page is a mostly perfect recereation of the Carleton Central login page, however it should be noted that the inputs for email and password have been hardcoded to send `email: "admin@email.com", "password"` which is the default login information for one of the default accounts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92644637-bc6e-436d-97ee-2df133262dca)

### Menu Page - `/`

The following page is known within the codebase as the "Menu Page". The only links that actually work on this page are clicking "logout", "Build Your Timetable/Registration", and "Student Timetables".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da5d65d2-ded5-4bcf-9349-30effe2a1d31)

### Build Timetable Page - `/timetables/build`

The following page is an amalgamation of the 4 different pages it takes in Carleton Central to build a timetable.

Upon clicking "search", a list of results will appear that can be added to your timesheet via their respective "add" buttons.

Selected events can be removed by clicking their associated "remove" button.

Upon clicking "create timetable", you will be redirected to that timetables "View Timetable Page".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86aff09c-4ff4-4240-b51b-14caf1774bbc)

### Timetables Page - `/timetables`

This is a page that does not exist in the real Carleton Central.

It acts as a way of all saved timetables associated with the account.

This screen may appear empty to you if you have not created a timetable on `/timetables/build`.

If you have created a timetable, you will likely see a stringified date string as its title, this is because the code the sends the create timetable request does not hard code a name so that it's easier to differentiate timetables:

```typescript
const createTimetable = async () => {
  const result = await ServiceAPI.createTimetable(
    new Date().toISOString(),
    selectedEvents.map((event) => event.id.toString()),
      jwt,
    );

    navigate(`/timetables/${result.data.id}`);
};
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a881efdc-ef92-423e-afb6-24c589b02396)


### View Timetable Page - `/timetables/:id`

The following page simple allows you to view a previously created timetable.

## API Routes

This application's RESTful API is powered by Express.js

All routes are appended underneith `{root}/api/v1/`. Ex: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/scheduledEvents`

**NOTE:** Any endpoint that **requires authorization** must be appended with the **Authorization header** and **jwt token** retrieved from the [login endpoint](#login---post-login).

Example Authorization Header:

```
authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkYXRhIjoiYWRtaW5AZW1haWwuY29tIiwiaWF0IjoxNzI4OTMzNTE2fQ.RM6l7bRyl7gGVeT6prdkaTu_LBB9vWobotIT2CwjLTM

# Workshops

## TypeScript Workshop

(details coming soon)

## React Workshop


### Option 1: If you have your environment setup:
1. Make sure you've completed [the client setup instructions](#client-setup).

2. Open `http://localhost:5173/workshop`


### Option 2: Utilize Stackblitz

1. Open this [Stackblitz link](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/hack-the-tunnels-starter-2024?file=client/src/pages/Workshop/Page.tsx&initialPath=/workshop).

2. In your terminal, run `cd client` then run `npm i` then run `npm run dev`

Note: You will not be able to make any API requests in Stackblitz (which is fine for the workshop)
